# Lifecycling

This is a non-profit dummy Android project that I worked on to understand activity lifecycle callbacks better.
I followed Treehouse Android Activity Lifecycle course and I also had some content from official Android documentation.
So some of the project content might belong to Treehouse and official Android documentation.
